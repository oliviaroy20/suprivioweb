				  <h2>About Us</h2>
				  	<p>
						Founded in 2018, out of frustration with a class assignment to build a pro forma, Chandler Crane (CEO), Minjie Lin (CTO), and Olivia Roy (CMO), came together to form Suprivio.
						We experienced the struggle of editing complicated formulas in Excel, learning new business terminology, and adusting our predictions. We needed our financials to be rock solid in order to impress investors; and if we can do it, so can you.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Suprivio, we pride ourselves on simplicity and accuracy. Business formulas are confusing, but are cructial to the success of your company. Not only are the formulas confusing, but the current methods involve YOU implementing them. Enough is enough. It is time for us to implement easy business tools for you to use. Not only are the tools intuitive, but they are also accurate.
						Pro formas show you how much money you think you will have, and how long this money will last, and to small and medium young companies, this can be the difference between life and death. Suprivio helps you strengthen your business.
					</p>

							<h4>Olivia Roy, CMO</h4>
							<p>
								Olivia Roy is a senior Computer Engineer major at the
								University of Notre Dame. She has completed projects
								including all parts of a working product, the front-end,
								back-end and everything in between. She has worked at
								MassMutual in the Customer Experience Division as a
								member of the front-end development team. Upon graduation, Olivia will be a full-stack developer at Wayfair.
								Olivia's immediate family has 3 accountants, so accounting principles and finance related discussions occur frequently.
								This has given her the base knowledge to successfully create financial documents. You could say that helping others with their finances runs in the family; Olivia simply brings a new, technology focused, twist to traditional accounting.
